# Example: Generated CLAUDE.md File

This is an example of a complete CLAUDE.md file that might be generated by the Claude Config Helper Skill for a typical web application project.

# Project Configuration for Claude

## Build and Test Commands

- Use `npm run build` to build the project
- Use `npm run dev` to start the development server
- Use `npm test` to run tests
- Always run `npm run lint` before committing changes
- Use `npm run type-check` to verify TypeScript types

## Code Style and Formatting

- Use 2-space indentation for all files
- Use single quotes for strings in JavaScript/TypeScript
- Add trailing commas in multi-line objects and arrays
- Maximum line length is 100 characters
- Use semicolons at the end of statements

## Architecture Patterns

- Follow the repository pattern for database access
- Use dependency injection for services
- Keep components small and focused (under 200 lines)
- Separate business logic from UI components
- Use custom hooks for reusable React logic

## Git Workflow

- Never commit directly to main branch
- Create feature branches with format: `feature/description`
- Write descriptive commit messages following conventional commits
- Always create pull requests for code review
- Squash commits before merging

## Environment and Configuration

- Never commit .env files
- Use .env.example as a template for required environment variables
- Store sensitive data in environment variables, not in code
- Document all required environment variables in README.md

## Testing

- Write unit tests for all business logic
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage
- Use Jest for unit tests
- Use React Testing Library for component tests
- Mock external API calls in tests

## Documentation

- Add JSDoc comments for all public functions
- Update README.md when adding new features
- Document API endpoints in the API documentation
- Keep inline comments minimal - code should be self-documenting
```

## Usage Context

This file would be created at `./CLAUDE.md` in the project root and would apply to the entire project. Claude Code would automatically load these rules when working in this project.

## How It Helps

With this configuration:
- Claude knows the correct build commands without searching
- Code style is consistent across all files
- Architectural patterns are followed automatically
- Git workflow is respected
- Security best practices are enforced
- Testing standards are maintained

## Verification

After creating this file, users can verify it's loaded by running:
```bash
/memory
```

This will show all loaded memory files, including this CLAUDE.md.

## Editing

Users can edit this file directly anytime:
```bash
/memory
```

This command opens the file in their system editor for quick updates.
